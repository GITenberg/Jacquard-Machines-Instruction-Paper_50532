<h2>JACQUARD MACHINES</h2>
</div>


<p>The term Jacquard Weaving may be applied to all harness
weaving that is above the range of harness shafts, so that a jacquard
machine is simply a shedding motion whereby a large
variety of sheds may be formed. The greater the number of lifting
hooks contained in a machine, the greater will be the range of
patterns that may be woven. Jacquard machines range from 100
to 2600 hooks.</p>

<p>Since its introduction the jacquard machine has undergone
many changes in regard to the methods of operating the different
parts of the machine, but the principles remain the same.</p>

<p>Jacquard machines may be classed under four heads, as follows:
<em>First</em>, Single Action Machines, meaning single cylinder
machines; <em>second</em>, Double-Lift Single Cylinder Machines; <em>third</em>,
Double Action Machines, meaning double-lift and two cylinders;
and <em>fourth</em>, Rise and Fall Machines, which have a close-shed motion.
There are also special machines.</p>

<p>When speaking of a jacquard, all the parts comprising the
machine and the harnesses are included. These may be classified
as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A number of wire hooks placed vertically in the frame
of the machine.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A number of wire needles placed horizontally between
the wire hooks.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A number of springs at one end of the needles.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Tail cords or neck bands attached to the bottom of the
wire hooks.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Harness threads which are attached to a coupling that
passes through the comber board.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) The coupling, which is usually composed of three or
four parts as follows:</p>

<p>A lingo, usually made of various weights of wire and which
is at the extreme end of the coupling; a double thread, commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
termed a hanger, which attaches the lingo to a mail eye; and the
mail eye, through which the warp yarn is passed. When there
are four parts, a double thread termed the mid-piece or sleeper is
attached to the top of the eyelet and is then fixed to the harness
threads mentioned at <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) The cylinder and its working parts.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) The griffe levers.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) The griffe.</p>

<p><strong>Hooks.</strong> A description of the great variety of hooks and
needles which have been used and which combine different ideas
as to their relative values and adaption for the various machines
in which they were or are used, will be both interesting and instructive.</p>

<p>In the old jacquard machine the hooks rested on a perforated
board, through which the neck cord passed, and the bottom of
the hook was bent up about five inches, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig01">1</a>. Bars
were passed through the turned up portion, as shown in the illustration,
to prevent the hooks from turning. The bars formed a
frame which was lifted when the griffe was raised.</p>

<p>The next hook, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig02">2</a>, was flat. This also rested
on a perforated board, and, to assist in keeping the hook in position,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
the needle was twisted around the hook. This kind of hook
and needle required too much time
and labor when one had to be replaced.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 4. Common Jacquard Hook.</p>
</div>

<p>The illustration, Fig. <a href="#fig03">3</a>, shows
the next form of hook that was used,
and which is used at the present time
in many French machines. This also
rested on a perforated board. The
chief object of this hook was to remove
the necessity of having springs
to force back the needles. At the
point marked A, a rod passed through
the hooks from one side of the machine
to the other, which kept the
hooks quite firm. Near the top of
the hook at positions B and B&sup1;, two
more rods were placed, one being at
the back of the hook and the other at
the front, the bottom of the hook being held firmly, while the rod
B pressing against the back portion of the hook caused a certain
amount of spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
The rod B&sup1; was to prevent the hook from swinging under the
blades of the griffe when the latter was descending. The needles
used with this hook had an elbow which pressed against the front
of the hook as shown at C.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 5. Showing Deep Griffe Blades.</p>
</div>

<p>What we shall term the ordinary shaped hook, but which
formerly was much thicker, was next used. This is illustrated in
Fig. <a href="#fig04">4</a>. The lower portion of these hooks passes through a grate,
each hook passing through a single slot. When first used, these
hooks were often bent or &ldquo;crowned&rdquo; under the griffe as it descended.
In some cases the trouble was due to the wire from
which the hook was made, but more often it was due to there being
too great a distance between the point where the needle was
in contact with the hook, and the griffe, causing the hook to swing
or vibrate. To overcome this defect, deep griffe blades (shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig05">5</a>) were introduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
The use of these deep blades made it difficult for the fixer to
replace broken hooks, in addition to adding weight to the machine,
so another change was made, deep and shallow blades being fixed
alternately; using hooks shown in Fig. <a href="#fig06">6</a>. In this arrangement
the long hooks had a tendency to swing back under the short
blade owing to the great length of the hook, when the loom was
run at a high speed.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 6. Alternate Arrangement of Griffe Blades.</p>
</div>

<p>The hook illustrated in Fig. <a href="#fig07">7</a> was then introduced. It will
be noted the wire extends some distance beyond the point when
the wire was bent to catch on the blade of the griffe. While they
were new, these hooks overcame the difficulty to a certain extent,
but as soon as they became worn, the top portion of the wire
would bend and break, falling into the machine.</p>

<h2>SINGLE ACTION MACHINE</h2>
</div>

<p class="caption">Fig. 9. Single Action Jacquard Machine.</p>
</div>

<p>The illustration, Fig. <a href="#fig09">9</a>, shows a jacquard known as the
<em>Single Action Machine</em>. The chief feature of this machine is
that the same griffe lifts the hooks for every shed, so the
griffe must descend before the next shed can be lifted. This allows
all the yarn to be lifted from the bottom shed. The single
action machine is convenient and well adapted to work when a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
high speed is not required; ninety to one hundred thirty picks per
minute being the most suitable speeds.</p>

<p>In the silk industry the single action machine is extensively
used as there is no danger of the cards becoming crossed. This
is a very valuable feature as wrong picks are often placed in the
cloth by a double cylinder machine through the skipping of the
cards.</p>

<p><strong>Construction.</strong> The single action is the original idea and is
the simplest machine. Fig. <a href="#fig10">10</a> shows a sectional view of a 400-hook
single machine. The meaning of the term 400-hook is as
follows: There are four hundred hooks and four hundred needles
in the machine which are in rows of eight hooks and eight needles.
It also means that there are four hundred harness threads to one
repeat of the maximum pattern that can be woven by the machine.
Nearly all machines have a few extra hooks (from 16 to
26) which are often classed with the regular number of hooks,
but are chiefly used for extra work, such as selvedge, extra harnesses,
etc. A pattern of less than four hundred to a repeat can
be woven, by casting out some of the hooks.</p>

<p>Referring to Fig. <a href="#fig10">10</a>, B is the needle board or plate, through
which the points of the needles E protrude three-eighths or one-half
inch. C is the griffe which is composed of eight blades; H
is the spring box, containing four hundred brass springs which
are placed against the back or loop ends of the needles, one spring
for each needle. G is the grate through which the hooks F pass.</p>

<p><em>Needle Plate.</em> In some cases the needle plate is made of
wood and in others it is made of metal, but the former is undoubtedly
the more economical from every standpoint. Particularly
is this shown in the single cylinder machines where the cylinder
travels at a faster rate of speed than a double cylinder machine,
consequently there is more movement and a larger amount
of friction between the needle and needle board or plate, which
results in rapidly wearing out the points of the needles if a metal
plate is used. Worn needle points cause a large amount of
trouble, for in single cylinder machines the cylinder has a tendency
to half-turn when the lay is pushed back by hand, and when the
cylinder returns to the needle points the corner of the cylinder
presses against them and invariably bends a number of the points
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
down on to the plate. This prevents some of the hooks which
ought to be lifted from being lifted, and causes some hooks to be
lifted which ought to be down.</p>

<p>A composition of powdered black lead and French chalk was
used to prevent the needle points from wearing out, but it was
discarded because the dust was constantly dropping into the harnesses
and yarn, and also was very disagreeable for the weaver.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 572px;">

<img src="images/jm12.png" width="572" height="476"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 10. Showing Arrangement of Hooks, Needles, Etc.</p>
</div>

<p>A needle board or plate for a 400-machine, has 416 holes,
arranged in 52 rows with 8 holes in a row. The rows are divided
by a groove into 26 rows on each side. There are also grooves at
each end of the needle board. The grooves are for the lacings
which hold the cards together.</p>

<p>The lacing naturally makes the card occupy more space at
the ends and center, because it passes along the upper and under
sides of the card, and if there were no grooves in the needle board,
the needles would have to be made longer so as to allow the points
to protrude farther out from the needle board; or when the card
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
was in contact with the needle points, the hooks would not be
pressed back far enough to prevent them from being lifted. The
grooves are also a great saving on the lacing of the cards, for if it
came in close contact with the needle board every time the cylinder
was drawn in, the lacing would soon be cut, and this often
causes the breakage of cards.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">

<img src="images/jm13.png" width="520" height="337"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 11. Showing Loops for Springs.</p>
</div>

<p>The reason for the extra rows of needles, is to allow the selvedge
to be worked by that row of hooks; also because a jacquard
sometimes has patterns added that require additional harness at
the front and back of the comber board, and the extra needles
are used for the working of the extra harness.</p>

<p><em>A spring box</em> is seldom used on American machines to hold
the springs that press back the needles, but where the spring box
is dispensed with, a longer loop is made on the back end of the
needle (see Fig. <a href="#fig11">11</a>) and the spring is placed on the loop, with the
cotter, which holds the needles. The spring box, however, is
most certainly of value if it is made to fit squarely in the framework
of the machine. The springs are kept cleaner and consequently
will give good results; and if a spring should break, it
can be replaced more readily in a spring box than if it were on
the end of a needle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
There is, however, one disadvantage in using the spring box,
for when the hole, through which the bolt, which holds the box
in position, passes, has become worn, some of the needles will be
pressing against the edge of the spring instead of the center, unless
care is taken in fixing on the box. This causes the needles to
stick in the box, preventing the hooks from working as they
ought to do.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 261px;">

<p class="caption">Fig. 12. Hooks Out of Perpendicular with Needles.</p>
</div>

<p><em>When placing hooks and needles in a machine</em>, one row of
eight needles is placed in first; that is, the needles are passed
through the bars that extend across the machine from side to side,
and into the holes in the needle board. On the bars the loop of
the needle rests, the bars keeping each 52 needles separate. The
first needle is the one that has the half circle, through which the
hook passes, nearest the needle board at the top (see Fig. <a href="#fig10">10</a>), and
the others are graded down until the eighth is placed in. This
will be the bottom needle with the half circle nearest the spring
box H.</p>

<p>When the cotter has been placed through the loop of the
needles, the hooks are placed in among the needles. The first
hook is pressed through the half circle of the needle and passes on
the outside of the others, which keeps the hook in position. The
second is placed through the half circle of the second needle, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
passes on the outside of the first needle and on the outside of the
lower needles. This rule is followed out until the eighth hook is
placed in position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 242px;">
<a name="fig13" id="fig13"></a>
<img src="images/jm15.png" width="242" height="343"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 13. Hooks Out of Perpendicular with Needles.</p>
</div>

<p>The grate through which the hooks pass is sometimes made
with extra rows of holes, and is also made so that it can be moved
around to help in the setting of the hooks. For this reason, it is
best, after placing in one row of hooks, to notice if they are
straight in the grate. If they are not straight, and cannot be
made straight by moving the grate, the next row of holes must be
used. If the hooks are not straight, even though they may work
freely, the needles, hooks and grate will be worn out in a very
short time.</p>

<p>The hook that passes through the first needle is considered
the first thread in the pattern, although when standing in front of
a single action machine, it is the last thread. In a machine that
has the needle board divided into twenty-six rows at one side of
the middle, and twenty-five at the other side, the twenty-six rows
are always at the left-hand side of the machine, looking at the
point of the needles. (So that the number end of the cards will
be at the left hand side of the machine, looking at the top needle
board.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
When all the needles and hooks have been placed in the machine,
the frame, in which the bars that support the top of the
needle are fixed, must be made perfectly straight with the needle
board. If they are not straight with each other, there is endless
trouble with the machine. In the first place, the loop of the
needle presses down the spring when the needle is forced back by
the card, instead of pressing the spring back straight in the box.
This will cause the springs to wear out sooner and they will often
stick, preventing the hooks from being lifted.</p>

<p>In the second place, the needle points will not be straight in
the needle board. This causes the hole in the board to be worn
crooked, also, the dust and oil that get into the back portion of the
board has a greater tendency to bind the needles when they are
not straight. The holes in the needle board at the back are counter
sunk, which allows the needles to be placed in
more readily when the machine is being fixed up, or
when a broken needle has to be replaced.</p>

<p>When the hooks and needles have been fixed, the
grate, needle board and needle frame adjusted, the
spring box is attached and every needle is tested and
made to work freely. After this is done, the griffe
is placed in the machine. It is absolutely necessary
that the griffe be made to lift straight, and each blade
or knife must be in exact position relative to the
hooks, or there will be a number of the hooks either
&ldquo;crowned&rdquo; or not lifted when they ought to be. The
griffe is made so that each side can be moved either
forward or backward, but it is sometimes necessary
to bend one or two blades of the griffe so as to have
them straight with the hooks. Figs. <a href="#fig12">12</a>, <a href="#fig13">13</a> and <a href="#fig14">14</a>
show crooked hooks and needles.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 14.</p>
</div>

<p><em>When the griffe is set</em>, the top of the blade ought to be just
touching the hook. If the hook is pressing too hard against the
blade, either the needle point must extend farther out from the
needle board, or the cylinder has to press hard against the needle
board when the hooks have to be pressed off the griffe. Either
case is detrimental to the machine. In the first instance, the
cylinder requires to pass farther out from the needle board, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
allow the cards to clear the needle points when the cylinder is being
turned, or there is a possibility of the edge of the card catching
on the needle points, preventing the cylinder from turning,
and causing misspicks. In the second instance, if the cylinder
presses too hard against the needle board, the lacing is often cut,
and the needles have a tendency to pierce the card where it is
blank.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
Having set all the inner parts of the machine, the next in
order is the tying on of the neck cords. Carelessness in the setting
of the inner parts so far mentioned cannot afterwards be rectified,
and means the loss of years of work from the machine besides
having endless trouble during the time it is working.</p>

<p><strong>The Outer Workings of the Machine.</strong> There are five distinct
methods of operating the movable parts of the machine: <em>First</em>, top
or overhead lever lift and independent batten or swing cylinder
motion; <em>second</em>, overhead lever and spindle cylinder motion; <em>third</em>,
overhead lever and independent slide cylinder motion; <em>fourth</em>,
bottom or cradle lever lift, and independent spindle cylinder motion;
and <em>fifth</em>, bottom or cradle lever lift and spindle cylinder
motion.</p>

<p>The first method is illustrated by Fig. <a href="#fig15">15</a>. It consists of a
lever at the top of the machine, or in some instances suspended
from the beam that supports the ceiling. The inner end of the
lever is connected by a link to the crossbar of the griffe. This
must be fixed exactly in the center of the crossbar so as to give a
straight lift to the griffe. To the outer end of the lever, a long
driving rod is attached. The bottom end of the driving rod is
placed on a stud attached to the hand wheel, which is fixed on the
crank shaft of the boom when the machine is a single lift. The
overhead lever is from thirty-six to forty inches long, according
to the width of the loom. On the thirty-six inch lever the inner
end, which is attached to the crossbar from the link to the supporting
stud, fixed in the bracket attached to the framework of
the machine, is about ten and one-half inches long, and the longer
end, which is attached to the lifting rod, is twenty-four to twenty-five
and two-thirds inches long. The throw from the center of
shaft to the stud fixed to the hand wheel is four inches. This
gives an eight inch stroke on the hand wheel.</p>

<p>Allowing for the fall of the griffe below the bend of the hook
the movement will give about a three-inch shed in the harnesses.</p>

The batten or swing cylinder movement is shown in detail in
Fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>. It is composed of five distinct parts as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Two small arms are fixed at the top of the machine, one
at each side. Two pointed set screws with lock nuts are set in the
arms and the batten or swing is supported on these points.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The batten, which is in the form of a square iron frame.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 566px;">

<img src="images/jm18.png" width="566" height="357"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 16. Details of Batten or Swing Cylinder Motion.</p>
</div>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Two cups set in the batten frame, which support the
cylinder. The cups are made of iron or brass and are held in
place by a bolt with thumb screw on the outside of the frame of
the batten. Set into the bottom of the batten frame and pressing
upwards against the cups, are two set screws whose purpose is to
raise or lower the cylinder.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The cylinder. This is a square prism with a number
of holes bored on each side to correspond with the needles in the
machine. On each of the four sides of the cylinder and near each
end there is a small brass peg (shown in Fig. <a href="#fig17">17</a>) for the purpose
of holding the card in the correct position on the cylinder. (The
perforations in the cards should be over the holes in the cylinder).
The pegs are set so they can be adjusted to the right or left. At
the ends of the cylinder square iron castings with rounded edges
are fixed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
(<i>e</i>) A spring hammer, the flat end of which rests on the
casting on the end of the cylinder. What might be termed the
handle of the hammer passes through the lower cross rail of the
bottom frames and through the top frame.
A spring is placed between the two rails and
around the handle of the hammer. The object
of the hammer is to keep the cylinder
perfectly level so that the cylinder will strike
the board level.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 18. Cylinder Out of True with Needle Board.</p>
</div>

<p>Flat springs also are attached to the inside
of the batten, the lower end of the spring
pressing the card to the cylinder. It is impossible
to overestimate the value of these
springs, especially on single cylinder machines,
for it would be almost impossible to
work without them. Their great value is shown when the cylinder
is leaving the needle board by preventing the card from swinging
on to the points of the needles, and also preventing the cards
from slipping off the pegs as the cylinder is drawn over by the
catch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
The catch is fixed to the framework of the machine, and
rests on the square casting fixed to the end of the cylinder. As
the cylinder moves out, the catch comes in contact with the
rounded edges of the square and in this manner the cylinder is
turned. There is also another catch fixed underneath, but it is
not in contact with the cylinder, and is adjusted so that it can be
raised up in contact and the top catch raised from contact with
the cylinder. This permits the cylinder to be turned back when
a lost pick has to be found.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;">

<img src="images/jm21.png" width="418" height="184"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 19. Iron Bar Supporting Batten Frame.</p>
</div>

<p>At each side of the batten frame toward the lower end, an arm
is fixed. To these arms rods that extend downward are attached,
and each rod is fixed to an arm that is set-screwed on a shaft supported
by brackets fixed to the arch of the loom. At the end of
this shaft another arm is fixed and is connected to the eccentric
rod that is attached to the clamp that encircles the cam or eccentric.
The cam is for the purpose of imparting motion to the
batten. The cam generally used to operate the batten is about
three and one-half inches from center of movement to extreme
outside length of cam. The cylinder is moved out from the
needle board from two to three inches.</p>

<p><em>For the saving of cards</em>, a great deal depends upon the movement
that is imparted to the cylinder. The less movement that
can be given to the cylinder, the better; that is, of course, when
obtaining the results required. The cylinder ought to be about
one-quarter inch from the needle points when commencing to turn.
Sometimes it is necessary to have the cylinder a little farther out,
especially when the cards have been stored in a damp place and
become warped so that they do not lie flat on the cylinder. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
this case, unless the cylinder is a little farther out from the needle
points when commencing to turn, the edge of the card will catch
on the needle points. This will throw the cards off the pegs and
cause a pick-out. If the distance traveled by the cylinder is too
short, it causes too sharp a turning of the cylinder, which has a
tendency to jump the cards from the pegs; and if the cylinder
moves out too far, there is too much friction on the working parts,
as the larger distance has to be traveled in the same space of time
as the shorter distance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 568px;">

<img src="images/jm22.png" width="568" height="267"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 20. Spindle Cylinder Motion.</p>
</div>

<p>When setting the batten frame by either the set screws or the
arms to which the set screws are attached, the principal point is
that the cylinder must be flat against the needle board, both at the
top and bottom of the board, and have the needle points as near
the center of the holes in the cylinder as possible. It is particularly
desirable that all points be square and straight with the
batten motion, because the batten, moving from a top connection,
performs an arc movement, and if the cylinder does not lie flat
against the needle board, some of the hooks will not be pressed
far enough off the griffe, or the points of the needles will come in
contact with the sides or bottom of the holes in the cylinder and
in that case, hooks will be down when they ought to be lifted.
Fig. <a href="#fig18">18</a> shows the cylinder set crooked with the needle board.</p>

<p>The set screw support for the batten frame is a very objectional
feature as will readily be seen, for the frame resting and
working on two points is a great strain and some part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
screw soon becomes worn. This, of course, lowers the cylinder.
When the cylinder is adjusted by turning the set screw, the frame
is not only raised higher but is moved to the right or left, which
throws the cylinder out of place, thus making double the amount
of work to adjust it.</p>

<p>The method of supporting a batten frame on an iron bar is
by far the best, as by this arrangement, the cylinder can be directly
adjusted. The illustration given in Fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, shows this
method of supporting the cylinder.</p>

<p>In the second method of operating the movable parts (see
Fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a>) the top motion remains the same as in the first, but the
method of operating the cylinder is different. Fixed to each side
of the square iron frame that supports the cylinder, is an iron
spindle, which passes through two brackets which act as slides for
the spindle and are fixed to the frame of the machine. Attached
to this cylinder spindle is a two-inch cranked slotted arm. Attached
to the spindle of the griffe is a small extension on which an
iron roller is placed. This iron roller sets in the slot of the
cranked arm; the slot arm being about seven inches long. The
seven inches is divided into three parts, the top and lower portions
being perpendicular, to allow a rest for the cylinder when it
is out from the needle board, and also when it is in contact with
the needle board. As the griffe is lifted, the roller passing up
the slot of the cranked arm forces out the cylinder. The distance
the cylinder is moved cannot be changed to any great extent, neither
can the time of the cylinder be changed, so that when a
warped set of cards is being used, there is always the tendency for
the cards to catch on the needle points.</p>

<p>In the third movement (see Fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>), the top motion is the
same as the first and second, but the cylinder movement is distinct.
A flat, iron casting which acts as a slide, is placed on each
side of the machine. These slides are supported by small iron
rollers, which are placed in brackets fixed to the frame of the machine.
At the end of the slide, a brass cup for the cylinder and
the spring hammer is fixed. A stud is attached to the slide.
The rod connected to the clamp of the cam (or what is called the
eccentric rod) extends upwards and is attached to an arm that is
set-screwed on a shaft, but extends upwards. This movement is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
one of the best. The brackets that support the rollers are adjustable
but seldom in the life of a harness do they require adjusting,
for if the rollers are well oiled they last many years, because the
friction is at the lowest possible point.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">

alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 21. Showing Overhead Lever Lift and Slide Cylinder Motion.</p>
</div>

<p>In the fourth movement a square cradle lever is placed in
brackets near the feet of the machine, and connected to the top of
the griffe spindle by means of an arm attached to the end of the
cradle lever. This is shown in the double-lift machine, Fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a>.
There is an arm at each side of the machine that is connected to
the cradle lever. To the outer end of the lever the long lifting
rod is attached. The length of the square lever is generally
twenty-eight inches from fulcrum to connection of long lifting
rod, and ten inches on the shorter end. This gives about a four-inch
lift to the griffe. The cylinder is driven by an independent
spindle motion. An iron spindle is attached to the frame that
supports the cylinder. The spindle passes through two slide
brackets fixed to the sides of the machine. Between the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
brackets and set-screwed on the spindle is an extension with a
stud attached to the top of it. On this stud, the connecting arm
from the lever is placed. The lever is supported at the top of the
same bracket that supports the square lifting lever. To the outer
end of the lever the eccentric rod is attached, but instead of using
a cam to give motion to the cylinder, one part of a double crank
is used, the other portion is used for lifting the griffe.</p>

<p>The fifth method is the same as the fourth with the exception
that the cylinder is operated by the slotted crank arm same
as in the second method.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2>DOUBLE-LIFT AND SINGLE CYLINDER MACHINES</h2>
</div>


<p>The illustration, Fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a>, shows a machine of this type. The
same methods are used to operate this kind of machine as are used
with the single action with this exception that there must be two
lifting levers, either overhead or cradle levers. The reason for
using this kind of machine is to have an open shed motion, and to
gain a little extra speed; but this naturally drives the cylinder
faster, consequently there is a greater damage done to the cards
unless great care is taken with them and additional appliances
used to prevent them from jumping off the pegs.</p>

<p>The needles and hooks used in this kind of machine are
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>. Each needle has two eyes or curves. The reason
for two eyes is as follows: There is but one cylinder and two
griffes, one of which is descending while the other is ascending.
The cylinder has to pass in for every pick; that is, for each lift of
the griffe, which necessitates the use of double the number of
hooks; so that in a 400-machine, there are 800 hooks, without the
extra ones. The top bend of every hook is turned in the same
direction, that is, toward the needle board.</p>

<p>The hook that is used on this machine requires a deep bend
at the top so as to have a firm grip on the griffe blade. This is
necessitated by the method of controlling two hooks with one
needle, for it sometimes happens that one hook is lifted while the
other is pressed back by the cylinder, so that the same thread will
not be lifted for the next pick.</p>

<p>The bottom of the hook is made in the form of a capital letter
V. The reason for this is that it saves a considerable amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
of friction by allowing the bottom of the hook that is lifted to
move back a little as the &ldquo;partner&rdquo; hook is being pressed by the
needle. This shape of hook saves the grate through which the
bottom of the hook passes. Fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a> shows the position occupied
by the hooks when one hook is lifted and the other hook (which
passes through the same needle) is pressed off. The dotted lines
show the original positions of the hooks.</p>

</div>

<p>In addition to the added friction on the needles and hooks, it
takes considerably more time to replace a worn needle than it does
in machines where single needles are used, for a rod has to be
temporarily inserted that will press to one side the two hooks
around which the needle has to go, and it is often necessary to
take out the hooks until the needle has been replaced, particularly
if the machine is an old one, or if deep blades are used in the
griffe.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2>DOUBLE ACTION MACHINE</h2>
</div>


<p>This means that there are two griffes and two cylinders. The
same methods are used to operate the moving parts, as are used on
the single action machines, but the lever and arms are used in a
compound manner. This machine is undoubtedly the best, where
large reproduction is aimed at, for it can be run 170 or 180 picks
per minute. The illustration, Fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a>, shows a double action
machine.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 24. Double Action Jacquard Machine.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>The shedding motion</strong> is obtained by means of a double crank
fixed on the end of the pick cam shaft, and to which the long lifting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
rods are attached. This is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>. Cams have
been used to take the place of the double crank, so as to allow a
dwell for the shed while the shuttle is passing through. It is particularly
desirable in a broad loom to have the shed full open for
a longer period in order to give clearance for the shuttle, but the
cam motion was proven to be somewhat detrimental, owing to the
quick rise and fall of the harnesses, which causes the lingoes to
jump and to be constantly breaking off. The neck cords also were
constantly breaking. The cam movement could be used successfully
with a jacquard that had not many harness threads attached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
to the neck cords, and had heavier lingoes fixed to the harnesses,
but for general use, the double crank is best, as it gives a more
even movement. There is also a short dwell while passing around
the extended part of the crank.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 107px;">

<p class="caption">Fig. 25.</p>
</div>

<p>The time to set the crank is to have it level, that
is, the two extreme points horizontal, when the crank
shaft is a little ahead of the bottom center, or to have
the reed about 1&frac12; inches from the cloth when the
shed is level.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 26. Showing Connection of Neck Cords to Hooks.</p>
</div>

<p>Owing to the general formation
of the double action
machine, that is, the use of
two hooks for one set of harness
threads, there is a somewhat
uneven movement to the
harnesses. When a griffe is
descending and some of the
hooks that are on the griffe
are to be lifted for the next
shed, and the hooks are passing
each other at the center
of movement, the angle of the harness
threads is changed, for as one hook is lifted
from the top shed, the neck cord attached
to the hook that is at the bottom is slack.
When this hook is raised for the next pick,
at the point when all the slack cord is
taken up, the uneven movement is caused,
the harnesses swinging over into the line
with the lifting hook. The results from
this movement are not so harmful if the
jacquard is tied up proportionally and run
at the right speed; but when the machine
is run too fast and the lingoes are too light, also when the neck
cord is too short, a large amount of trouble is caused.
Instead of connecting the harnesses to the hooks, by means of
two neck cords, one is used as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a>. The link answers
the purpose for which it is intended, that is, to take away the slack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
neck cord. It also reduced the uneven movement. However, unless
the hooks are kept perfectly straight, the link will not work,
and it is common for a hook to be bent a little underneath the
grate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 569px;">

<p class="caption">Fig. 27. Arrangement of Needles and Hooks in Double Action Machine.</p>
</div>

<p>When one neck cord breaks on the ordinary double action
machine, the defect is not readily seen, because the harness cord
will be lifted by the other hook, unless it is a pattern where that
particular hook from which the cord has broken is lifted very
often. When the link is used, all the harness threads that are
attached to the link will fall, owing to the use of only one neck
cord; this also occurs on the single action machine.</p>

<p><strong>Needles.</strong> The illustration Fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a> shows the arrangement of
needles in a double action machine. The first needle at the top
marked A, controls the hook B, passing down in regular order
until the bottom needle in the right hand needle board, marked C,
controls the hook D. The first needle in the left hand or bottom
needle board, marked E, controls the hook F, which is the partner
to D, that is, F and D control the same harness threads, as will be
noticed by the connection at the bottom G. The eighth needle in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
the bottom needle board, marked H, controls the hook K, which
is the partner hook to B. The bottom set of needles is exactly
like the top set. They are placed in the same relative position,
but work from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>There being two cylinders on this type of machine, one passes
in as the other is going out. Both cylinders turn toward the
machine as indicated by the arrows, and a glance at the two cards
A and B with holes marked 1 and 2, and needles marked the same
will show the two hooks F and D control the same harness threads.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 28. Showing Levers, Supports and Studs.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that one hook has the top bend bent backward,
while the other bends forward in the same direction as the
lower bend of the hook. The reason for this latter is that it would
require more space in the grate and the needles would have to be
longer, which would make a broader machine if the same shape of
hook were used; so that by the use of these hooks, considerable
space is gained.</p>

<p>When cutting cards for a double action machine, each card is
cut from the design singly, just the same as if cutting cards for a
single action machine. After the cards are cut, they are divided,
the odd numbers from the even numbers, so that when laced they
form, as it were, two sets of cards, one set being placed at one side
of the machine and the other set at the other side of the machine.</p>

<p>A double action machine is composed of double the number
of working parts that are on a single action machine, but they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
placed so as to work in different directions, with the exception
that with an independent cylinder motion only one eccentric rod
is used, and the eccentric is placed on the pick cam shaft. But if
the cylinders are operated by a spindle motion, a slotted crank arm
is attached to the lifting rod of each griffe and the cylinder is
moved out as the griffe to which it is attached is raised, one cylinder
moving out from contact with the needle board as the griffe,
that comes in contact with the hook controlled by the needles of
that board, is raised, at the same time the other cylinder is passing
in towards the needle board while the second griffe is descending.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 29. Rack Method of Lifting Griffe.</p>
</div>

<p>When using the cradle lever on a double action machine, it is
necessary to have two different sizes of lifting cranks to allow extra
lift for the difference in length of the levers, owing to one of
the levers working on the inside of the other. The length of
levers used is about 30 inches for the longer end, from fulcrum to
connection of lifting rod, and 13 inches for the shortest end on the
longer lever. Fulcrum to connection of lifting arm on the shorter
lever is 25 inches, and 10 inches on the shorter end. The double
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
crank is made so that the one with the 12-inch stroke is attached
to the shorter lever, and the 10-inch stroke operates the longer lever.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 30. Pulley and Belt for Lifting Griffe.</p>
</div>

<p>The cradle lever lift is used only on machines that have the
harnesses attached to them by the cross tie system, because by the
straight tie system the machine is turned in the opposite direction;
that is, one set of cards would be over
the cloth in the loom, and the other set
over the warp; and in the cross tie system
the cards are over the sides of the
loom or over shuttle boxes.</p>

<p>The top lever lift is considered by
many to be the best method of operating
the griffes, and this method can be used
whether the harnesses are attached by
the straight tie or the cross tie system.
All that is required to be changed is
that where as in the straight tie both the
levers are on the same stud, and fixed to
one support, the levers for the cross tie
are placed on separate studs with separate
supports. The reason for using
separate supports and studs is to meet
the different positions of the griffe bar.
(See Fig. <a href="#fig28">28</a>.)</p>

<p>Other lifting methods have been
successfully tried on double action machines; one being a rack
movement shown in Fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a> and another a pulley and belt lift
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a>.</p>

<p>The rack movement is as follows: A 1&frac12;-inch iron shaft is
supported in bearings fixed to the top of the machine. This shaft
extends over the end of the machine. The supports are bolted to
the cross rail of the griffe, and on these supports the racks are
fixed. The shaft passes between the two racks, and the gear is
fixed on the shaft in contact with the rack. An arm is set-screwed
on the outer end of the shaft, and to this arm a long lifting rod is
attached. The bottom of the rod is placed on a stud attached to
the face of a round iron plate that is set-screwed on the pick cam
shaft.</p>

</div>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a> the pulley A is supported on a shaft in the same
position as the gear for the rack motion, and to the pulley a strip
of belting B is attached, each end being fixed to the cross rail of
the griffe at C. The belt motion is a simple arrangement, but the
griffe must act freely and perfectly straight or the griffe will not
descend low enough to allow the hooks to be pressed off by the
cylinder.</p>

<h2>THE RISE AND FALL OR CLOSE SHED MACHINE</h2>
</div>


<p>The illustration, Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>, shows a machine of this type. Its
purpose is to have all the harnesses level at the center movement.
The same working parts are used on this machine as are used on
the single action, the distinctive difference being that cranked
levers are attached to the usual lifting levers so that the grate
through which the hooks pass can be raised and lowered, and so
that the griffe is raised only half the usual distance.</p>

<p>After the cylinder has pressed off the hooks that are not to
be lifted, the grate descends with these hooks, and at the same
time the griffe raises the hooks that are to be lifted.</p>

<p>On some rise and fall machines, a batten cylinder motion is
used, but is fixed in the opposite position from the usual batten
motion; that is, the batten swings from the bottom instead of
from the top of the machine, the set screws that hold it in position
being placed in brackets fixed near the feet of the machine.</p>

<p>These machines cannot be run at a high speed, 130 being
considered average, but faster speed is obtained when the pattern
is equally balanced so that about the same number of ends are
raised, as are falling. This style of machine is now extensively
used for weaving table cloths, silk goods, etc.</p>

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
